# Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting the language of a given text input using machine learning techniques.  
It is implemented in Python with the help of Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text data
- Training a language detection model
- Support for multiple languages
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Easy-to-use prediction function

## 📂 Project Structure
- `LanguageDetection.ipynb` → Main notebook with code and analysis
- `data/` → (Optional) Folder for datasets
- `models/` → (Optional) Trained models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Extract text features
3. Train classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
4. Evaluate accuracy and performance
5. Use trained model for predictions
